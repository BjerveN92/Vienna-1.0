        As many other roman cities in centraleurope Vienna was founded 
        by the romans as a former celtic settlement.
        Vienna was also besieged by the Ottoman empire 1529 & 1683.
        Both times the city was able to hold out, 
        the second time with help from poland.

        In 1814-1815, the Congress of Vienna was held in the city, 
        which marked Vienna's place in the European politics of the time. 
        During the 19th century, the city center was remodeled. 
        The old ramparts that protected the inner city were then demolished, 
        but at the same time blocked inner and outer Vienna. 
        The new land was used for the creation of new large parade streets in the city.

        Around the turn of the century in 1900, Vienna was a meeting point 
        for a number of philosophers and scientists, including Sigmund Freud.
